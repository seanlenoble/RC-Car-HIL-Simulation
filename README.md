# RC-Car-HIL-Simulation
simulation of an RC car using hardware in the loop and 2 Arduinos. The simulator program was provided by a professor and the controller programs were written by myself and a teammate.

Launch control adjustes the voltage of the motor so that the front and rear wheels have a constant slip ratio of 0.2

Cruise control adjusts the voltage such that the car drives at a desired forward velocity
